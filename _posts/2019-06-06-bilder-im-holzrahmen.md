![RG Rahmen 13](images/Gallery/rg-rahmen-13.jpg)

A 3D wireframe graph, if rotated with the mouse, 
in paint mode,
meaning that the current picture is not erased when a new one is drawn,
will fill the whole TPaintBox area quickly.

> It is important to find the right time to make the screenshot.

There are rotations, and translations, and model shape changes in the mix.
All of this is using old GDI graphics, no anti-aliasing available.
Today, with modern graphics, impossible!

In a session, on a cold November day, I created 256 screenshots, and then stopped.
